	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hi, I'm Christina Powers from the Great Lakes, Mitten state, formerly known as Michigan. I grew up in the mid-eastern part of the region, in a little town called Midland. Being outdoors was a big part of my life ever since I can remember, there isn't much else to do in Michigan, so naturally I still have a connection to being around nature. Fishing is my upmost favorite outdoor sport, for the most obvious reason being that I was surrounded by the Great Lakes. Don't get me started on the snow! Although it isn't for everyone, I think I miss it every now and again, especially during the holidays and snowboarding season. There's nothing more magical then a snowy, lit up ski resort during December!</p>

	<p>I've always been the creative type, as it runs in my genes. Music, writing and art have always been my forte. I began playing the piano at a very young age, then picked up the saxophone from 5th grade to my senior year in high school. Writing came naturally to me as my imagination likes to run wild with ideas. But drawing and painting was what gave me the most joy. Junior year of high school, in art class, I had a pivotal moment. I painted The Beatles in watercolor, used a graphic pen, and put handwritten lyrics in the background. My art teacher said that my artwork had a very 'graphic style,' to it and suggested that I take a print tech course. Obsessed with Tim Burton at the time, I was very ecstatic to hear that. I'm glad I took my teacher's advice because I fell in love with the design process.</p>

	<p>Central Michigan University is where I began my journey to becoming a Graphic Designer. I took a wide variety of art courses from; sculpture, painting, drawing, printmaking, typography, motion, web (currently refreshing these skills through General Assembly) and of course art history; all of which helped shape me into an open-minded and well-rounded designer. Shortly after completing my Bachelor of Fine Arts, I made a big move to Atlanta, Georgia. I was eager to gain experience in my career and only a couple of months went by before I landed a marketing position with Metrotainment Cafes where I had the opportunity to put my graphic design skills to use, also leading to the marketing knowledge I have acquired over the years. Just a northern girl in a southern world, trying to grow and meet my potential, taking opportunities as they arise. Since moving to Atlanta, networking and making friends has given rise to occasions where I have been able to do some freelance design as well.</p>
	
	<p>When I'm not creating or designing, you will most likely find me outdoors. Some of my hobbies and interests include: going on hiking or camping adventures with my husband and our dogs, chasing waterfalls, fishing, fitness, yoga, snowboarding, painting and drawing, gardening, nose stuck in a book, watching films or just relaxing. I'm always on the look-out for something new to do or try!</p>
